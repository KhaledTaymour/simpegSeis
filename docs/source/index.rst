SimPEG (Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics) is a python package for simulation and gradient based parameter estimation in the
context of geoscience applications. simpegSeis uses SimPEG as the framework for the forward modeling and inversion of seismic geophysical proble

We consider two fundamental governing equations for seismic wave propagation: acoustic and elastic wave equations in both time and frequency domains. We initially discretize those problems to compute forward responses. Obvious next step is to solve inverse problems
